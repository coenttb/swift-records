# Parity Audit Prompt

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Purpose**: Final comprehensive parity audit comparing upstream packages with our PostgreSQL implementations

## Context

We have implemented PostgreSQL variants of Point-Free's Swift query infrastructure:

**Upstream Packages** (SQLite-based):
- `/Users/coen/Developer/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries` - Query language foundation
- `/Users/coen/Developer/pointfreeco/sqlite-data` - SQLite database operations

**Our Packages** (PostgreSQL-based):
- `swift-records` - PostgreSQL database operations (analog to sqlite-data)
- `swift-structured-queries-postgres` - PostgreSQL query language (variant of swift-structured-queries)

## Audit Objectives

Generate a comprehensive `PARITY_AUDIT.md` document that:

1. **Identifies alignment** - What we've successfully matched from upstream
2. **Documents differences** - Where we intentionally diverged (PostgreSQL-specific features, async/await, etc.)
3. **Finds gaps** - Features in upstream that we haven't implemented
4. **Validates architecture** - Confirms we're following upstream patterns correctly
5. **Plans next steps** - Prioritized roadmap for achieving full parity

## Audit Scope

### 1. Package Structure

Compare:
- Module organization (targets, products)
- File structure and naming conventions
- Public API surface
- Internal vs public declarations
- Dependencies and their usage

**Deliverable**: Section showing side-by-side package structure comparison

### 2. Query Language Parity

Focus: `swift-structured-queries` vs `swift-structured-queries-postgres`

Compare:
- Core types (`Table`, `Statement`, `QueryRepresentable`, etc.)
- Query builders (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Operators and expressions
- Join support
- Aggregate functions
- Subquery support
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions
- Type safety mechanisms
- Macro implementations (`@Table`, `@Relation`, etc.)

**Deliverable**: Feature matrix with ✅/❌/⚠️ status for each capability

### 3. Database Operations Parity

Focus: `sqlite-data` vs `swift-records`

Compare:
- Connection management
- Transaction support
- Migration system
- Query execution (sync vs async)
- Error handling patterns
- Batch operations
- Connection pooling (if applicable)
- Type conversions
- Date/Time handling
- BLOB/Binary data handling
- JSON support

**Deliverable**: Feature matrix with implementation notes

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

Compare:
- Test database setup patterns
- Schema definitions used in tests
- Test data fixtures
- Assertion helpers (assertQuery, etc.)
- Snapshot testing approach
- Test organization
- CI/CD considerations

**Deliverable**: Testing pattern comparison with examples

### 5. API Patterns

Compare specific API patterns:

**Database Access**:
```swift
// Upstream (sqlite-data)
@Dependency(\.defaultDatabase) var database
let records = try database.read { db in
    try Record.fetchAll(db)
}

// Ours (swift-records)
@Dependency(\.defaultDatabase) var database
let records = try await database.read { db in
    try await Record.fetchAll(db)
}
```

**Query Building**:
```swift
// Upstream
User.select { $0.name }
    .where { $0.age > 18 }
    .order(by: \.name)

// Ours
User.select { $0.name }
    .where { $0.age > 18 }
    .order(by: \.name)
```

**Deliverable**: Side-by-side API comparison with code examples

### 6. Documentation

Compare:
- README completeness
- Code documentation coverage
- Usage examples
- Migration guides
- Architecture documentation

- [ ] Migration rollback
- [ ] Schema introspection
- [ ] Query planning/EXPLAIN
- [ ] Foreign key management
- [ ] Index management

**Deliverable**: Feature checklist with priority levels (P0/P1/P2)

## Audit Process

### Step 1: Inventory Upstream (30 minutes)

For each upstream package:
1. Read Package.swift to understand structure
2. List all public targets and products
3. Examine main public APIs (read exports.swift or key files)
4. Review README and documentation
5. Check test infrastructure

### Step 2: Inventory Ours (20 minutes)

For each of our packages:
1. Same process as Step 1
2. Note any obvious differences as you go

### Step 3: Feature-by-Feature Comparison (60 minutes)

For each major feature area:
1. Find upstream implementation
2. Find our implementation
3. Compare signatures, behavior, tests
4. Document status: ✅ Full parity, ⚠️ Partial/Different, ❌ Missing
5. Note reasons for differences (async/await, PostgreSQL-specific, etc.)

### Step 4: Gap Analysis (30 minutes)

1. List features in upstream we don't have
2. Categorize by importance (P0: Critical, P1: Important, P2: Nice-to-have)
3. Estimate implementation effort (Small/Medium/Large)
4. Consider if each gap is actually needed for PostgreSQL use case

### Step 5: Generate Report (30 minutes)

Create `PARITY_AUDIT.md` with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed comparisons by section
- Feature matrices
- Gap analysis with priorities
- Recommended next steps

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Are we following upstream architecture correctly?**
   - Module boundaries
   - Separation of concerns
   - Extension points

2. **What features are we missing that users expect?**
   - Based on sqlite-data API
   - Based on swift-structured-queries capabilities

3. **Where have we intentionally diverged, and is it justified?**
   - Async/await (required for PostgreSQL)
   - Connection pooling (not needed for in-memory SQLite)
   - Schema isolation in tests (PostgreSQL requirement)

4. **What PostgreSQL-specific features should we highlight?**
   - MVCC concurrency
   - RETURNING clauses
   - Advanced types (JSONB, arrays, etc.)
   - Full ACID transactions

5. **Are our tests as comprehensive as upstream?**
   - Test coverage
   - Test patterns
   - Edge cases

6. **Is our documentation as good as upstream?**
   - README quality
   - API documentation
   - Examples

## Success Criteria

The audit is successful if it:

1. ✅ Provides clear percentage of parity achieved (e.g., "85% feature parity")
2. ✅ Identifies all major gaps with clear priorities
3. ✅ Documents intentional differences with justification
4. ✅ Gives actionable roadmap for achieving full parity
5. ✅ Highlights our PostgreSQL-specific advantages
6. ✅ Can be used to guide next 3-6 months of development

## Output Format

- Single file: `PARITY_AUDIT.md`
- Markdown format with tables and code examples
- Clear visual indicators (✅/⚠️/❌)
- Links to specific files when referencing implementations
- Estimated reading time: 30-45 minutes
- Comprehensive but scannable (good use of headings)

## Notes for Execution

- Be thorough but pragmatic
- Don't list every minor difference - focus on user-facing features
- Consider PostgreSQL vs SQLite differences when assessing gaps
- Some "gaps" may be intentional (async/await) or irrelevant (SQLite-specific features)
- Look at actual usage patterns in tests to understand how APIs are meant to be used
- Check for consistency in naming, patterns, and idioms
