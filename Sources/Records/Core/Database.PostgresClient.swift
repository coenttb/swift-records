    ///     username: "user",
    ///     password: "pass",
    ///     database: "mydb",
    ///     tls: .disable
    /// )
    /// 
    /// let client = PostgresClient(configuration: config)
    /// 
    /// // Run the client in a background task
    /// Task {
    ///     await client.run()
    /// }
    /// 
    /// // Use as Database.Writer
    /// let users = try await client.read { db in
    ///     try await User.fetchAll(db)
