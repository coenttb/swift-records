  /// A PostgreSQL notification payload that is guaranteed to be valid UTF-8.
  ///
  /// This type ensures that:
  /// 1. Payloads are validated as UTF-8 **once** at creation time
  /// 2. UTF-8 → Data conversion is cached and reused
  /// 3. Invalid UTF-8 is caught at the boundary (when receiving from PostgreSQL)
  ///
  /// ## Example
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // From PostgreSQL notification
  /// let payload = NotificationPayload(validated: notification.payload)
  ///
  /// // Decode as JSON
  /// let event = try payload.decode(as: ReminderEvent.self)
  ///
  /// // Access as string
  /// print(payload.string)
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Performance
  ///
  /// The UTF-8 encoding is cached, so repeated access to `.data` or `.decode()` doesn't
  /// re-encode the string. This is significantly faster than re-encoding on every access.
