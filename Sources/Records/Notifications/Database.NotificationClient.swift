extension Database {
    /// Dedicated PostgresClient for LISTEN/NOTIFY connections (optional optimization).
    ///
    /// **You typically don't need this client** - the notification API automatically
    /// uses your existing database connection pool. This dedicated client is an
    /// **optional optimization** for production systems with many concurrent listeners.
    ///
    /// ## When to Use
    ///
    /// Use the dedicated notification client when:
    /// - You have 10+ concurrent LISTEN connections
    /// - LISTEN connections are long-lived (minutes to hours)
    /// - You notice query performance degradation due to pool exhaustion
    ///
    /// For most applications (including all tests), the default behavior is sufficient.
    ///
    /// ## Configuration
    ///
    /// This client is specifically configured for long-lived notification subscriptions:
    ///
    /// - Long connection idle timeout (1 hour vs 60s default)
    /// - Keep-alive pings to maintain connection health
    /// - Bounded concurrency to prevent resource exhaustion
    /// - Separate from query connections to avoid interference
    ///
    /// ## Architecture Decision
    ///
    /// LISTEN connections have fundamentally different lifecycle characteristics than
    /// query connections:
    ///
    /// **Query Connections** (fast lease/release):
    /// ```
    /// Acquire → Execute Query (milliseconds) → Release
    /// ```
    ///
    /// **LISTEN Connections** (long-lived subscriptions):
    /// ```
    /// Acquire → LISTEN → Wait for notifications (seconds/minutes/hours) → UNLISTEN → Release
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Mixing these in the same pool causes:
    /// - LISTEN connections block query connections from being used
    /// - Query connection timeouts interrupt long-running listeners
    /// - Pool exhaustion when many listeners are active
    ///
    /// ## Configuration
    ///
    /// The notification client is configured with:
    /// - **Minimum Connections**: 2 (pre-warmed for common case)
    /// - **Maximum Connections**: 50 (allows many concurrent listeners)
    /// - **Idle Timeout**: 1 hour (long-lived subscriptions)
    /// - **Keep-Alive**: 5 minutes (detect dead connections)
    ///
    /// These can be overridden via environment variables:
    /// - `NOTIFICATION_MIN_CONNECTIONS`
    /// - `NOTIFICATION_MAX_CONNECTIONS`
    /// - `NOTIFICATION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
    /// - `NOTIFICATION_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS`
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Notification client is automatically used by notifications API
    /// let stream = try await db.notifications(on: channel, expecting: MyType.self)
    ///
    /// // Monitor pool health
    /// let client = Database.notificationClient
    /// logger.info("Active listeners", metadata: [
    ///     "connections": "\(client.eventLoopGroup.description)"
    /// ])
